# HelpingHands
I have created a website called "Helping Hands" in teleporthq template using HTML and CSS, with a vision of providing part-time job opportunities and assistance to those in need. The site aims to foster community development by connecting willing volunteers with individuals who require help due to job constraints or age-related limitations.
